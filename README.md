## Online CV
This code file shows the code for my online, web-based, interactive CV/Portfolio made using JavaScript (React), HTML, and CSS.

I am using Chakra UI's framework to assist in designing this website with several useful features such as Box, Container, Button, Accordion, and many more.

My images and logos used were retrieved from sources such as Pixabay and Logo.com, which are royalty free, or from official organisations, where the copyright regulations are met and were retrieved from the official source.

May not be currently optimised for mobile phones, but this may change in the future.
